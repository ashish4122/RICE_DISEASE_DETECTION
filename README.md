DATASET- [Rice Diseases Image Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/minhhuy2810/rice-diseases-image-dataset)

## **Overview**

Rice is a staple food for a significant portion of the world's population, making it crucial to identify and mitigate diseases that affect rice crops. Traditional methods of disease detection are often labor-intensive and prone to errors. This project utilizes advanced deep learning techniques to automate and improve the accuracy of rice disease detection.

## **Approach**

### **1. EfficientNet-B4**
- **Objective:** To utilize the power of EfficientNet-B4, a state-of-the-art convolutional neural network known for its efficiency and accuracy in image classification tasks.
- **Method:** EfficientNet-B4 is pre-trained on ImageNet and fine-tuned on a dataset of rice crop images to identify various diseases.

### **2. Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM)**
- **Objective:** To enhance the model's focus on critical areas of the image by integrating an attention mechanism.
- **Method:** The CBAM is added at the end of the EfficientNet-B4 model. It helps the network focus on relevant features by applying spatial and channel-wise attention, thereby improving the overall performance.

### **3. Integration of CBAM with EfficientNet-B4**
- **Objective:** To combine the strengths of EfficientNet-B4 with the attention capabilities of CBAM to achieve higher accuracy in disease detection.
- **Method:** After training the EfficientNet-B4 model, the CBAM is integrated into the network. This enhances the model's ability to distinguish between healthy and diseased crops by focusing on the most informative parts of the image.

## **Results**

The integration of CBAM with EfficientNet-B4 has resulted in a significant improvement in the model's accuracy and ability to detect rice diseases. The model effectively focuses on the regions of the image that are most indicative of disease, leading to more reliable predictions.

## **Conclusion**

This project demonstrates the effectiveness of combining attention mechanisms like CBAM with powerful pre-trained models like EfficientNet-B4 for agricultural applications. The enhanced focus on relevant features enables the model to achieve higher accuracy in rice disease detection, contributing to more efficient and automated crop monitoring solutions.
